                <p className={styles.aboutDescription}>
                  I enjoy exercising and tracking my habits to improve them over time. I believe that anyone can become talented if they believe in themselves. I enjoy reading books and finding new ideas from them. My coworkers say that I am a good team player and that I help keep the team happier and less stressed when a release is coming.
